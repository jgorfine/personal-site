                                            introduce you to accessibility overlays today. I wish I could tell you this was a great,
                                            awesome thing in the world of accessibility, but it's quite the opposite. So I'm going to
                                            first introduce you to what they are, then we'll talk through why they're not so great. And then we'll talk through why this is coming up now, both in the world of accessibility, and also for us here at FiscalNote —why I wanted to speak on this as soon as I found out about it. So, first of all, what even are accessibility overlays? According to Karl Groves, who is a premier accessibility expert, it's basically just a term for code that is injected into a website that claims to make that website more accessible. Typically, it's JavaScript code. Here are some companies that are selling overlays. You may have heard of some, or none of these. accessiBe in particular is one that we are going to highlight. All of them offer similar products: basically install our code, and we can make your website completely compliant for you. Here's an example of what one looks like, on the Oreo website. This is accessiBe's overlay here on the right. This is a screenshot I took the other day. And that's a GIF of me just scrolling through it. As you can see, they they do offer a lot. So they claim that they can change the alignment of your text, they can change the colors, ensuring contrast. They claim to be able to have images, make it more keyboard-navigable...all good things in theory, right? In theory. Other things that kind-of define these overlays, they're sometimes called widgets. Sometimes they can even, they can even try and change what's happening on the page, for example, making pop ups more readable by a screen reader. They try. Specifically I think accessi- accessiBe claims that they have a machine algorithm that can generate alt text for images. Often these things are sold as, like, cheaper than hiring developers really quick to implement since it's just one line of code. WCAG —they're, they're marketed, of course, as being WCAG compliant. And, if you install this tool, then you will be compliant. And no one will sue you because you'll now have this great accessible website, right? Well, that's not really how it's shaken out. They're...they're not great. And they're not great for a variety of reasons. For one thing, it kind of introduces this idea that we can automate ethics, right? That if we just rely on machines, and rely on code that generates code, then we can kind-of make all these things accessible, without really thinking about the people that we're seeking to help. Often these overlays do more harm than good, actually. They interfere with preferences and technologies that users already have set up in place...which, you know, overriding user preferences is probably not a great idea. Because it's usually injected into a site with a script, that is something that can be turned off or it can fail. There's even a tool that's come about called AccessiByeBye, which kind-of leverages the fact that these things can be turned off. Someone can install AccessiByeBye as a Chrome extension, and intentionally turn it off, because it is so not helpful to people. And overall, just as a business model, it's really sucky. It, it sends the message that, like, you as a company don't have to have good code because you can have someone else take care of it for you, it sends the message that you don't have to be accountable for making your own tools and products accessible, because again, someone else will just handle that for you if you give them a certain amount of money. And that's not really a great culture to be creating, especially around something as important as accessibility and inclusion. So I found a couple of videos, actually, that show for us exactly why these things don't work. This is an example of a video showing how the accessiBe overlay actually traps the user's focus on the page, when trying to use the page. Here we go.</span>

And there have actually been numerous pros, accessibility pros, who have conducted audits on the overlays, and have found that just even as a product, they are not accessible, which is very ironic, especially when you can white-label it, like you saw that it had the yellow background color. Being able to white-label it like that, you potentially run into a situation where you can have color contrast that isn't high enough. I'd actually be curious if that yellow color with the white text meets color contrast.</span>

                                            sometimes will buy it as a temporary fix or as a holdover until the rest of their team can make the site accessible. But if it's already working, in your mind, why would you go back and make it better? Like, or why would you pay those devs' salaries when you can pay $49 a month, which is apparently what accessiBe offers with their fancy machine learning algorithm? Right? Oh...oops.</span>

                                              data-end="853.000">Okay, so I also just wanted to share, in addition to that video, just a
                                            few testimonials that have been gathered on this website, called Overlay Fact Sheet, which has been monitoring sort-of the landscape of overlays and is seeking to give people more information about why they are actually a bad practice. So here's an example: accessiBe adds a lot of extra heading level twos. Other tables I have read become virtually unusable with things like accessiBe. Focus jumps all over the place. Here's someone who's blind saying it absolutely 100% is worse for both me and my wife, who are both blind. And here's someone who basically sums it up: accessibility overlays are not the answer. You know, this person uses a screen reader and it is worse. So, why are we talking about this? Now, if these technologies have been around for a while? Well, a lot of these companies have received misguided praise and funding accessiBe, in particular, recently had a $40 million round of funding. And that means that they will be able to continue doing what they're doing. They seem, in all of their marketing copy, like they're well-intentioned, their mission statement, apparently, is to make the entire web accessible by, like, 2025 or something. So they seem like not bad people, they seem like they are well-intentioned, but just the way they're going about it is not great. And it is because they are getting so much positive media attention, that a lot of pros have come forward to speak out against them, against other companies like them. And I actually was first made aware about all of this, just by seeing the chatter happening on Twitter. On the Overlay Fact Sheet website that I mentioned, there's a petition, actually, that's out there for anyone to sign. I signed it. It currently has over 330 signatures of accessibility pros and web, and web pros and accessibility advocates who all say, you know what, this is not the right way forward. This is actually causing more harm than good. A big part of why accessibility overlays are a hot topic is because of lawsuits. Two kinds of lawsuits in particular: one in which companies with inaccessible websites are being sued. For example, Domino's was sued, and it went all the way to the Supreme Court. And the Supreme Court, in 2019, ruled that as part of the American Disabilities —With Disabilities Act, the ADA, which mostly, I think, up until that point had been interpreted as physical spaces — that that law had to apply to physical spaces. But that Supreme Court decision, then made it so that...that decision now also applies to virtual spaces and websites. And so the person who filed the suit won, and it was a big deal. The reason why lawsuits are scary for companies is that companies don't want to be the ones who are sued, can lose a lot of money that way and reputation. And if there is an option out there that, like Patrick was saying, you just want a quick win... It can be very tempting to reach for one of these and use it on your site. But that being said, there are now companies that are being sued specifically for using these accessibility overlays. I read an article that summarized at least three different cases in which accessiBe was named as said, I guess, like a perpetrator or a vendor, again, is being used by the company that was being sued. So this is I think, like the next evolution of lawsuits, you know, there were cases against totally inaccessible sites. And now there's lawsuits against sites that claim to be accessible, but aren't, because of technologies like this. So, it's kind of a big deal.</span>

                                              data-end="890.000">And then there's even more drama. You know, because these accessibility
                                            overlay companies are trying to preserve their own name and reputations, there has been some retaliation happening, from what I read. accessiBe deleted some comments that were left on their website that were critical of them and their product. I saw a Tweet this —just this morning about a French company that was sending letters to the employers of people who were speaking out against them and are, like, bullying people into silence. So, it's kind-of a real thing that's happening.</span>

                                            our product, as we ourselves are looking for ways to make our products and...and websites better. You know, it can be very tempting again to reach for something like this, which claims to do all these things well, but doesn't. So I wanted you all to have this information so that we can resolve to do better.</span>

And it's got to be baked in from the beginning. Obviously, if you ship a product without doing any of that work, you're going to be in a spot is gonna be very difficult to get to.

But again, like, a lot of the complaints are that it's not sophisticated enough, it doesn't actually give you anything that's actually meaningful or helpful. Like the idea is kind-of cool, I'll give you that. But it's currently right now being portrayed as this is the alternative to doing things...well. Or right. So, un, unless it can be used in such a way where you're doing it to complement good practices, I cannot, in good conscience, think of this as being cool.-->

<!--                            Yeah, go for it.-->

<!--                            Alice Packard  24:32-->
<!--                            So um, yeah, I'm just going through the options in this overlay. And there's this amazing thing that I can do, where I can adjust the colors of titles. I'm assuming a bunch of like things like h1 through h6 or whatever. And one of the color options is white. The majority of the backgrounds on this website are white. I don't know. In any of your research, I don't know how deeply you dug into these, but: I'm wondering if this, if Oreo just kind-of went with this, like, out of the box, like, if this is accesiBe's, just, default set of options? Or if when you purchase these things, you can kind of make some tweaks. I don't know why white would be an option if, if somebody was combing through and looking at this.-->

<!--                            Jennifer Gorfine  25:17-->
<!--                            Um, so I didn't get that deep into the weeds with it. I did, I did read that, again, you can white-glove the service. So, like, you can change the color of your overlay. I don't know if that means that you can then like toggle certain features on and off, or, like, opt into some features, but not other features. We can go on the accessiBe site and see what they have to say. Part of my —my instinct is, is that, you know, why would someone opt out of certain features when that's, you know, the whole thing they're paying for? Is to have the convenience of someone just telling you what you need.-->

<!--                            Alice Packard  26:05-->
<!--                            Right. And I would think if this is supposed to be kind of like smart in some ways, if it recognizes that you're using white backgrounds, and your text is sitting on those white backgrounds, white should not be an option for the text colors. Like, shouldn't it have some contrast checker built in? And palettes would adjust accordingly?-->

<!--                            Jennifer Gorfine  26:25-->
<!--                            You would think so! I mean, the cool thing is that, I think there, you know, it is entirely possible to implement a similar feature using something homegrown. Like, it would be, I think, yeah, it would be way cooler if Oreo or us or anyone, knowing what the color of the site was, like, I have seen some sites that offer similar widgets, but they don't seem to be one of these out-of-the-box solutions. I think actually the White House website now, as soon as the, as soon as the administration changed, they added this little toggle here on the side, I'll share my screen again. I think I started a thought and didn't see it all the way through, which is that if you know your own site, you can maybe offer options that work within your site's color palette.-->

<!--                            Alice Packard  27:27-->
<!--                            Totally.-->

<!--                            Jennifer Gorfine  27:27-->
<!--                            So here's these options here: toggle high contrast, toggle large font size. I think these are, these are probably just simple buttons that exist here on the side. Maybe they leverage something like CSS classes or CSS variables to change things? Like, if I turn on high contrast... See, look, now there's a class name like toggle-contrast-active. This changed color. Let's see what background color comes from. Background color? Oh, no, it's this alert bar. So, it looks like accessibility-contrast is, like, a specific class name, and they're doing it using their own CSS. They just changed the background color. So, like, that is a legitimate way of doing this. This is an example of, you know, we took the time and coded it. To do it. I'd be curious, actually, to see in a test if this is something that would be well received. You can change the font size. Whoa.-->

<!--                            One of the things I would say, you know, there's so many —so many people who need accessibility have their favorite tools they want to use, there's an argument to be made just to set your products up so they work as best as possible with those tools, rather than trying to make your own tools. You know, so... and, or, and they also have their own defaults, like every browser will allow you to change defaults, right? So as much as possible, you want to get out of the way. You know, the kind of people who need accessibility accommodations 24/7, they probably have a workflow that works for them, and I think as much as possible, we don't want that.-->

<!--                            Yeah. Oh! We are at time. Thanks so much, everyone.-->

<!--                            Yeah, definitely.-->
